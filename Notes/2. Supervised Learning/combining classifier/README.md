### Combining Classifier
- We can combine the results in some learning based to hit more accuracy
- Main idea is combining some determiner how the final result can be better 
- Each learner know a special part of data and domain, so to combine the results together we get more details
- static structures (Ensemble averaging, Boosting)
    - Ensemble averaging:
        - Plurality voting
        - majority voting
    - Homogeneous Ensembles
        - Bagging
        - Boosting
            - weak/strong learners
            - target is combining on collection weak learners
            - implementations
                - filtering
                - sub-sampling
                - re-weighting
            - AdaBoost (ADAptive BOOSTing)
                - increase wrong answer weights(sum of weak learners, make a strong learner)
- Dynamic structures (Mixture of experts, Hierarchical mixture of experts)
    - Mixtures of experts
        - gating (softmax)
