### bayesian algorithm
- work based on classifier
- can continuously learning
- MAP(maximum a posterior probability)
- Brute-force MAP learning
- Optimal Classifier(A weighted majority classifier)
- Naive bayes classifier
    - good for big data
    - estimate  based on repeat count 
- m-estimate: prevent zero results
