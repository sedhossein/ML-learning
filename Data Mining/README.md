### Basic Concepts
-  <b>Itemset</b>: A set of items
-  <b>k-itemset</b>: An itemset with k items.
-  <b>Support count</b>: Number of transactions that contain an itemset
-  <b>Support ratio</b>: Fraction of transactions that contain an itemset
-  <b>Frequent itemset</b>: An itemset whose support is greater than or equal to a minsup threshold

### Lets Find Frequent Patterns
![pattern](./images/1.png)

â€¢ Brute-force approach:
- Each itemset in the lattice is a candidate frequent itemset
- Count the support of each candidate by scanning the database
- Match each transaction against every candidate
- Complexity ~ O(NMw) => Expensive since M = 2^d (M is the length of candidates)
